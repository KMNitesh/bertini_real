\subsection{Instructions for GNU/Linux}

You are very strongly encouraged to use the package manager provided, such as {\tt apt} or {\tt yum}, to install the dependencies.  See Section~\ref{sec:deps}

If using Matlab, and you do not already have it on the path, type \texttt{touch .bash\_profile}, which will create \texttt{.bash\_profile}, and then add \texttt{export PATH=/PATH/TO/MATLAB.app/bin:\$PATH}. This should result in the Matlab executable being added to the path whenever opening terminal.  Note that there are several possible files into which to place this, and this particular method of using {\tt export} is shell specific.  The {\tt csh} is a little different, for example.
