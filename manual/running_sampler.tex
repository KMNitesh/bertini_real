\section{Running Sampler}
If you are happy with the results of the Bertini\_real decomposition, you may wish to refine the triangulation of the surface or curve. This can be acheived using the \texttt{sampler} program after calling \texttt{bertini\_real}. Call \texttt{sampler} on the command line, e.g. \texttt{sampler -fixed 10} to sample each cell to have approximately $10^d$ samples on it, where $d$ is the dimension of the component.
