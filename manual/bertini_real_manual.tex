\section{Introduction}


Welcome to Bertini\_real, software for real algebraic geometry.  This manual is intended to help the user operate this piece of numerical software, to obtain useful and high-quality results from decomposing real algebraic curves and surfaces.

Bertini\_real is compiled software, links against a parallel version of Bertini 1 compiled as a library, and requires Matlab and the Symbolic Computation toolbox.  It also requires several other libraries, including a few from Boost, and an installation of MPI.  All libraries should be compiled using the same compilers.

\section{Quick Start}

Bertini\_Real can be downloaded from http://bertinireal.com/download.html. Use of Bertini\_Real depends on Bertini, which itself has several important dependencies (see section 3)
Once installed, you can run Bertini\_real on an input file from the command line. After navigating to the working directory of the input file, the flow of Bertini\_real is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Run Bertini on an input file using the ``tracktype: 1'' setting. This is done by typing in the command line: \texttt{bertini} with an input file named `input'. Bertini will produce a Numerical Irreducible Decomposition that will be used by Bertini\_real.
\item Run Bertini\_Real on the same input file. Similarly, just type \texttt{bertini\_real} in the command line. Bertini\_Real will provide a cellular decomposition of the real portion of a one- or two- dimensional complex algebraic set.
\item Visualize the results of Bertini\_real in MATLAB. Enter MATLAB and call gather\_br\_samples, which parses the output results of Bertini\_real into a .mat file, and then call bertini\_real\_plotter, which will plot the curve or surface in MATLAB (N.B. The MATLAB executable must be on the path to the input file for Bertini\_real to run).
\end{enumerate}

\section{Compilation and Installation}
\subsection{Installation}
Before installing Bertini\_real, you must first be sure to have several libraries and dependencies that the software requires. \par
First, you must install Bertini (as a library).  The Bertini source code can be found \newline at https://bertini.nd.edu/download.html. Download the Bertini source code using the ./configure \&\& make \&\& make install process. \par
Bertini itself has the following dependencies: a C++ compiler capable of the C++ 11 standard, an MPI (such as MPICH2), Boost $>$= 1.53, MPFR, and GMP. Instructions specifically for Mac users are listed below. If on Linux, use the package manager provided (e.g. apt-get). Unfortunately, Windows users are unsupported at this time, except possibly through Cygwin or a virtual machine. If interested in porting Bertini and Bertini\_real to windows, please contact Dr. Brake at dbrake@nd.edu. Bertini\_real also is dependent on MATLAB. Once Bertini and all the necessary dependencies are installed, navigate to the directory containing Bertini\_real and install Bertini\_real via the ./configure \&\& make \&\& make install process. \par
\subsection{Installation of Bertini/bertini\_real on macIntosh}

\indent If you are using a mac, we encourage the use of Homebrew (http://brew.sh) to install these packages. After installing Homebrew itself, installing the previously listed dependencies becomes simple. In terminal, just type, \texttt{brew search \_\_\_\_} to list packages related to \_\_\_\_, where \_\_\_\_ is your search (for example, GMP, Boost, or MPICH2). To download via Homebrew, type in terminal: \texttt{brew install \_\_\_\_}.
